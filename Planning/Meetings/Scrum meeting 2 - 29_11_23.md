### What was achieved in the last sprint?

- More solid requirements and project vision was established.
- Wrote user stories for the functionality the app should have.
- Initial wireframes for the UI were created.
- Began work on creating UML diagrams, created initial sitemap and class diagram.

### Plans for next sprint

- Continue working on UML diagrams (sequence diagram, use case diagrams, state diagrams, etc)
- Begin working on a prototype for the UI that incorporates elements such as a tab and modal system.
- Add to the Kanban so that it better details what needs to be done in the next sprint and for the project backlog.

### Other considerations

During this meeting, I asked whether tools such as TypeScript would be allowed for this project. I was informed that it is not an option I can use to develop my web app.

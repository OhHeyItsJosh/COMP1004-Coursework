### plans for the next sprint:

- Getting down and finalise the requirements for the project as well as planning down user stories.
- Create a basic skeleton webpage for the layout of the app and maybe some wireframes to show what more advanced functionality may look like.

### Considerations

Consider if I want to use any frameworks or dependencies for the project. I obtained confirmation that we are most likely allowed to use things like web frameworks and APIs for this project.

What functionality do I want to app to have? I need to get a more solid idea of how the app is going to function and what features it is going to have.

Fortunately, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is something that I already have plenty of experience with. That means that it isn't something I have to put extra time into learning.

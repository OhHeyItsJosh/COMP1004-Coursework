### Plans for next sprint

- Continue working on UML diagrams (sequence diagram, use case diagrams, state diagrams, etc)
- Begin working on a prototype for the UI that incorporates elements such as a tab and modal system.
- Add to the Kanban so that it better details what needs to be done in the next sprint and for the project backlog.

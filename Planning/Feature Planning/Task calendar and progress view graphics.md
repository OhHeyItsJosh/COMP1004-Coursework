These graphics are planned to appear on the dashboard tab for my application.

### Tasks Calendar

Like in the wireframe, this calendar will take up a large amount of space on the right hand side of the dashboard tab.

Calendar should be divided into 7 columns corresponding to the 7 days of the week.

Will display all tasks that have a timeframe that falls within the current week.
- Each task will have its own row and will span from the day it starts to the day it ends.
- If the task started before the current week or ends after the current week, it will span up to the first or last day of the week. Might use some sort of icon to signify this.

The user should be able to click on a task to view and interact with it (like the task cards in the task tab).

### Task Progress Graph

This graphic will be placed under the weekly progress header on the dashboard tab.
It will reflect the number of tasks that have been started / completed for a given day of the week.

This will likely be displayed as some sort of bar graph.
Clicking on one of these bars should display the tasks that were started / completed on that day.
